Just like Laplace's demon, but instead of predicting the universe, it’s all about cookies! — The Cookie Profit Predictor mod introduces a suite of strategic tools designed to optimize your resource management and decision-making:

# Payback Efficiency Indicator
This feature shows how quickly you'll earn back your investment in Cookies Per Second (CPS). It's essential for maximizing your gameplay.

* **Tier Upgrade Path Planning**: Helps you figure out the benefits of buying multiple buildings to reach the next tier upgrade, improving your payback efficiency.
    
* **Rainbow Highlighting for Interim Purchases**: Uses colors to highlight purchases that may not be the best but can speed up your progress toward more valuable long-term investments.
    
* **Customizable Color Coding**: Adjust the colors used for efficiency indicators to match your personal style.
    

# Item Timer
Keep track of how long you need to wait before you can afford a new building or upgrade, making it easier to plan your strategy.

# Banking Strategy Integration
Set a target banking cookies (how many seconds based on CPS) to optimize your savings for big payouts like "Lucky!" bonuses.

# Auto-Sorting by Payback Efficiency
Automatically organizes buildings and upgrades by their payback efficiency, helping you prioritize the best purchases.

* **Wizard Tower Exclusion Feature**: Choose not to include Wizard Towers in your efficiency calculations, allowing you to maintain specific spell intervals without disrupting your strategy.

# Auto-Buy Functionality
